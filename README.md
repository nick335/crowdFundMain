This is a solution to the [Sunnyside agency landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/crowdfunding-product-page-7uvcZe7ZR).

## The challenge
- this project took me longer to complete due to its complexity which i underestimated at the begining of thr challenge
- I had issues with the overlay that comes in when the popup is intiated, precisely the height, i had to give a height manually;

## My process


### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Google Fonts
- javascript


### What I learned
- I learned to how use the 'margin: -px' property instead of of using the position absoluete and relative property
- I also improved on my general knowledge on javascript and working with localstorage.

### Continued development
- I will like to improve my knowledge of css animation especially the way the popup comes in.
- Also the structure of my HTML code, i think it will be very confusing for others to read
- And also the ability to detailed names to classes. 

### Useful resources
- (https://stackoverflow.com/)- this helped a lot in dealing with multiple problem i occured while coding like responsivness, positioning of text over images and hamburger menu
- (https://www.w3schools.com/) this helped improve my knowledge of flexbox and grid
- (https://www.codegrepper.com/) this helped with the popup background and javascript;

## Questions
- how to make the height of the popup background cover the entire height of the page automatically?
- is there any other way to convert a number to a currency value other than the method I used, I used this method 'String.Format(new System.Globalization.CultureInfo("en-US"), "{0:C}", 5620000)' but it didn't work
- any suggestions to further improve the project will be much apperaticated
